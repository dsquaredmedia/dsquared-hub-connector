# Changelog

All notable changes to the Dsquared Hub Connector will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Auto-updates enabled by default.** The plugin now opts itself into WordPress's `auto_update_plugin` filter, so new releases are applied automatically overnight without requiring the user to click "Enable auto-updates" in the Plugins screen. Site owners can still opt out by setting the `dhc_disable_auto_update` option to `true`.

### Fixed
- Tightened the Hub's `/api/plugin/update-check` fallback so it queries GitHub Releases dynamically instead of returning a hard-coded (and drifting) version string.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **AI Discovery module** — Generates `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` for AI search engine discovery, injects LocalBusiness schema, and pings IndexNow (Bing/Yandex) when content changes. Includes a business profile editor in the admin settings.
- **Content Decay Alerts module** — Scans all published posts for freshness, flags stale content (6+ months yellow, 12+ months red), and reports findings to the Hub for content health monitoring.
- **Form Submission Capture module** — Hooks into Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, WPForms, Elementor Forms, and Ninja Forms. Filters spam in real-time using disposable email detection, keyword blocking, velocity limiting, and gibberish detection. Sends clean leads to the Hub pipeline without storing personal data locally.
- **Self-hosted auto-updater** — Checks `hub.dsquaredmedia.net` for new plugin versions and integrates with WordPress's native update system. Users see update notifications in the admin just like any other plugin.
- **WordPress Privacy Policy integration** — Hooks into WordPress's privacy policy page generator to disclose data collection practices. Includes GDPR-compliant personal data exporter and eraser (returns empty since no PII is stored).
- **GPL v2 License file** for WordPress.org compliance.
- **WordPress-format readme.txt** with proper sections for potential directory submission.
- AI Discovery settings tab in admin UI with business profile editor.
- New module cards for AI Discovery, Content Decay, and Form Capture in the Modules tab.
- PHP 7.4 and WordPress 5.8 minimum version checks on activation.

### Changed
- Version bumped from 1.0.0 to 1.5.0.
- Tier module mapping expanded: Growth tier now includes `content_decay`, Pro tier includes `ai_discovery`, `content_decay`, and `form_capture`.
- Admin UI updated with new tabs and module cards.
- Uninstall routine updated to clean up new module options and cron jobs.
- REST API expanded with new endpoints for AI Discovery, Content Decay, and Form Capture.
